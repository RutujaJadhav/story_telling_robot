Ribi-Story telling robot

Problem: Parents sometime do not have time to entertain their kids but they would rather not let their kids have screen time.

Proposed solution: Children treat social robots more like social actors than passive (or even interactive) agents rendered on a screen. As a result, their brains work more similarly to when they are in the presence of social agents (i.e. when they are developing social skill and learning from other agents).

Prototype specifications:
The robot is programmed by a parent(to add books as of now) but will interact with a child. Stories are told in an interactive way where the child is asked questions or tells parts of the story. The voice interface(eSpeak) also helps read the story for the child. 

The robot should uses face recognition(opencv,scipy) for determining when a child is in front of the and determine if the person in front of the robot is an adult or a child.
